This is an interactive web-based Quiz Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players with multiple-choice questions presented one at a time. Users enter their name before starting via a modal pop-up. A countdown timer adds urgency. The game includes localStorage integration to save score history for replay value and performance tracking.

## UX

### The 5 Planes of UX

#### 1. Strategy

**Purpose**
- Provide users with some quiz questions to test their knowledge on HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- Deliver instant feedback of answers to improve usability and encourage learning.
- Support accessibility and user-friendly interactions.

**Primary User Needs**
- Users want an engaging way to test their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge.
- Users expect feedback, scores, and progress tracking.

**Business Goals**
- Create an educational yet fun quiz that improves learning retention.
- Showcase frontend development skills and JavaScript interactivity.



#### 2. Scope

**[Features](#features)** (see below)

**Content Requirements**
- A bank of at least 10 questions (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Instructions and score summary
- Descriptive UI texts and labels

#### 3. Structure

**Information Architecture**
- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Simple navbar with accessible links.
- **Hierarchy**:
- Questions are categorized by topic (HTML, CSS, JS) but shuffled
- Result history stored and optionally viewable

**User Flow**
1. User lands on the home page ‚Üí reads brief instructions.
2. A modal appears: Brief quiz description, Input for player name, ‚ÄúStart Quiz‚Äù button
3. Start Quiz: Timer begins (e.g., 60 seconds)
4. User selects an answer:Button color changes to green/red, Answer buttons become disabled, ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button becomes visible
5. End of Quiz; Happens when: All questions are answered OR Time runs out
Final score shown:
Correct & incorrect counts
Personalized message
6. Save Score; Result stored in localStorage: Player name, Score, Time, Option to ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù
7. View History: User can open a section to view past attempts (score history from local storage).

#### 4. Skeleton

**[Wireframes](#wireframes)** (see below)

Interface Design:

Large central quiz box for readability

Timer and score counter visible at the end

Answer buttons styled for interactivity

Feedback for correct/incorrect answers at the end

Navigation Design:

Linear navigation through questions

‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù resets game from the modal

#### 5. Surface

**Visual Design Elements**
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)** (see below)
- **[Typography](#typography)** (see below)

### Colour Scheme

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/080708-3772ff-df2935-fdca40-e6e8e6) to generate my color palette.

- `#000000` primary text.
- `#341F36` modal text.

### Typography

CSS styles used

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.

| Page | Mobile | Tablet | Desktop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/mobile-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/tablet-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/desktop-home.png) |
| 404 | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/mobile-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/tablet-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/desktop-404.png) |

## User Stories

| Target | Expectation | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| As a user | I would like to input two numbers and select an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) | so that I can calculate a result. |
| As a user | I would like the application to show me an error message if I enter empty input (`NaN`) | so that I understand what went wrong. |
| As a user | I would like the calculation to happen instantly after I select an operator | so that I get my result quickly without waiting. |
| As a user | I would like the application to have clear and large buttons for each operator | so that I can easily select the correct one on any device. |
| As a user | I would like the application to have high-contrast colors and accessible fonts | so that I can easily read and interact with it. |
| As a user | I would like clear labels and instructions | so that I understand how to use the app without confusion. |
| As a user | I would like the app to show me the correct result if my equation was incorrect | so that I understand how the answer was calculated. |
| As a user |  I would like to see how many equations I get correct or incorrect | so I can push myself to improve my math skills. |
| As a user | I would like to see a 404 error page if I get lost | so that it's obvious that I've stumbled upon a page that doesn't exist. |

## Features

### Existing Features

| Feature | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start modal | When the user opens the quiz, a modal appears asking for their name. It also provides a brief game description and a "Start Quiz" button. This personalizes the experience and gives users context. | ![screenshot](documentation\features\modalpage.png) |
| Multiple-Choice Questions | The quiz pulls from a question bank (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript topics) | ![screenshot](documentation\features\questions.png) |
| Answer Feedback| When a user selects an answer, immediate visual feedback (color-coded) indicates whether it was correct or incorrect. The correct answer is also highlighted. | ![screenshot](documentation\features\answerfeedback.png) |
| Game Timer | A countdown timer starts when the quiz begins. If the time runs out before the user finishes, the game ends automatically.| ![screenshot](documentation\features\timer.png) |
|Responsive Design| The entire quiz layout adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.| ![screenshot](documentation\features\responsive.png) |
|Score Tracking| The user's score is tracked in real-time based on correct answers and shown at the end of the game in a result summary.|(see photo on  Score tracking) |
|Local Storage for Score History| After each game, the user's name, score, and time are saved in localStorage, allowing them to view their quiz history even after refreshing the page.| (see photo on  Score tracking)|
|Replay Functionality| TUsers can restart the quiz anytime using the "Play Again" button, resetting the timer, questions, and score.|(See answer feedback photo) |
| 404 | The 404 error page will indicate when a user has somehow navigated to a page that doesn't exist. This replaces the default GitHub Pages 404 page, and ties-in with the look and feel of the *Quiz Website*| ![screenshot](documentation/features/404.png) |

### Future Features

Leaderboard: how a leaderboard of top players based on scores and time, connected to a backend.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

‚ö†Ô∏è TIP ‚ö†Ô∏è

Consider adding screenshots of your Projects Board(s), Issues (open and closed), and Milestone tasks.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END ---‚ö†Ô∏è

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/mairima/pp2-codequiz/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/mairima/pp2-codequiz/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/mairima/pp2-codequiz)](https://www.github.com/mairima/pp2-codequiz/issues) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-open.png) |
| [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/mairima/pp2-codequiz)](https://www.github.com/mairima/pp2-codequiz/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png) |

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

### Content

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to provide attribution links for any borrowed code snippets, elements, and resources. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every resource used, not just a generic link to the main site. If you've used multiple components from the same source (such as Bootstrap), then you only need to list it once, but if it's multiple Codepen samples, then you should list each example individually. If you've used AI for some assistance (such as ChatGPT or Perplexity), be sure to mention that as well. A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.
